# decent FOV values for AIM: 10, 10, 340, 20, 10

# decent FOV values for NEAT: 20, 20, 315, 45, 15

# the lower you set nearest obstruction precision, the slower the simulation --> decent value = 0.6

# nice pedestrian waypoints for single intersection: (167,155),(146,155)
                                                     (157,147),(157,167)

# checkpoint at end of each road:           (28,150),(28,156)
                                            (157,28),(163,28)

# once a vehicle enters the intersection, notify its sensor that it's in the intersection. Then, if the vehicle exits the intersection successfully, notify the sensor of that.
If the vehicle has entered the intersection but veers off onto the grass, the sensor must not register this as "successfully leaving the intersection", rather it must tell
the car to get back into the section

#NB: When testing AIM with reckless vehicles and/or pedestrians, only record a collision if a normal car
#intersects the shape of the reckless car or the pedestrian.
#--> this is necessary because the built-in Shape.intersects() method for Rectangle2D shapes seems to have
#a precision error which is causing the simulator to think two vehicles are colliding when AIM is the controller
#and no obstacles/obstructions are present... but, under non-obstructed conditions, it is not possible for a collision
#if AIM is the controller.
