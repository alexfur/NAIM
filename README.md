# Neuroevolution for Autonomous Intersection Management

This project extends the AIM4 simulator to support decentralised Artifical Neural Network vehicle controllers evolved using neuroevolution.

A future in which driverless cars standardise the vehicle industry appears to be inevitable. AIM (Autonomous Intersection Management) is a multiagent intersection control paradigm designed to maximise efficiency on the roads by removing traditional control mechanisms, such as traffic lights, from intersections and coordinating driverless cars using centralised wireless arbiter systems installed at every intersection.

This project explores the effect of replacing AIM's centralised arbiter model with a decentralised model in which each vehicle coordinates itself using a neural network controller evolved via neuroevolution (Encog-NEAT).
